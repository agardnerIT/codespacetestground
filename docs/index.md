# Demo Tutorial Homepage

This is the tutorial homepage.

We can theme this site as we want (matching DT branding / DevRel specific branding or colours?)

The website is just a series of `.md` files, so we can easily port the existing content here.

## Batteries Included: Search
The site comes with search functionality already included.

## Batteries Included: Usage / Adoption Tracking
A DT JS tag is embedded in the `<head>` of each page so full tracking is possible.

Give a brief tutorial intro, embed a video or whatever.
